# 3.Bootstrap

Bootstrap made it easy to create a responsive layout with minimal effort. The grid system and pre-styled components (like the navbar and alerts) saved time, but I felt limited when trying to customize beyond the default themes. The documentation was clear, but overriding Bootstrap styles would require additional CSS.

# 2. Tailwind CSS

Tailwind was more flexible than Bootstrap but required memorizing many class names. I liked how I could build unique designs without leaving the HTML, though the markup became cluttered. The responsive modifiers (e.g., md:grid-cols-2) were intuitive once I got used to them.

# 3. React.js

Reactâ€™s component model made it easy to manage UI logic (e.g., toggling messages with useState). The learning curve was steeper than CSS frameworks, but the reactivity and reusability were rewarding. The CodeSandbox environment simplified setup, though debugging props/state took some practice.
